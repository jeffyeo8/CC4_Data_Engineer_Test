# CC4_Data_Engineer_Test
This repo contains datasets, code, documents relevant to the GovTech Data Engineer (CareerCoach) Test 2024.

To run the code locally, you may just download the zip file attached to the email or download the zip file from Github via this link: https://github.com/jeffyeo8/CC4_Data_Engineer_Test.git. For the code to run smoothly, please extract the entire zip file into your local directory because the code will not be able to access the given datasets if u access the files from the zipped folder. 


_**Task 1**_ <br>
You may open the 'Task_1.ipynb' file from the Task_1 folder to view the code for Task 1. If using VScode, please ensure that you have the jupyter extension and pandas package installed. This file was run using Python 3.11.2. You may choose to run the entire code in 'Task_1.ipynb' from top to bottom to obtain my answers for Q1, Q2, Q3.  

The resulting files for Task 1 Q1 and Q2 are named 'restaurants.csv' and 'restaurant_event.csv' respectively and running the jupyter file will overwrite both files which should not be an issue.

For Question 2, I assumed that each restaurant's past events could be found under the "zomato_events" attribute. I also assumed that the question was asking for a list of past events and their respective restaurants in which the past event's start date falls before or on April 2019 and its end date falls after or on April 2019.

_**Task 2**_ <br>
Please access the "Task_2" folder to access the materials for Task 2. Due to time constraints, I was only able to complete the API Document and Database Schema. You may ignore the "Task_2.ipynb" file as I just used it to view the data summary of the given datasets.
