# CC4_Data_Engineer_Test
This repo contains datasets, code, documents relevant to the GovTech Data Engineer (CareerCoach) Test 2024.

To run code locally, download the zip file from Github and extract the folder from the zip file. You may then open the 'Task_1.ipynb' file to view the code for Task 1.

***Task 1***
You may run the entire code in 'Task_1.ipynb' from top to bottom to obtain my answers for Q1, Q2, Q3.  

The resulting files for Task 1 Q1 and Q2 are named 'restaurants.csv' and 'restaurant_event.csv' respectively and running the entire code would overwrite both files which should not be an issue.

For Question 2, I assumed that each restaurant's past events could be found under the "zomato_events" attribute. I also assumed that the question was asking for a list of past events and their respective restaurants in which the past event's start date falls before or on April 2019 and its end date falls after or on April 2019.

***Task 2***
Due to time constraints, I was not able to complete Task 2.
